MIDI bass pedals - salvaged from an organ and given an Arduino brain

Bass pedals are fun, but cost a kajillion dollars for some reason.  Meanwhile, people are throwing old organs off of overpasses.  This project salvaged a set of bass pedals from a discarded Wurlitzer home organ and adds MIDI output using a $5 knockoff Arduino Uno.  

$5 is less than a kajillion.

Use the also excellent Hairless MIDI application to read the serial stream from the Tau pedals:
