MIDI bass pedals - salvaged from an organ and given an Arduino brain

Bass pedals are fun, but cost a kajillion dollars for some reason.  Meanwhile, people are throwing old organs off of overpasses.  This project salvaged a set of bass pedals from a discarded Wurlitzer home organ and adds MIDI output using a $5 knockoff Arduino Uno.  

$5 is less than a kajillion.

These are inspired by the Moog Taurus pedal bass synthesizer, but fall far short since an actual synth isn't included.  There are excellent free plugins and cheap analog synth clones to be had, though, which Tau will happily control.

This project was inspired by an excellent wikihow from from amandaghassaei:

Use the also excellent Hairless MIDI application to read the serial stream from the Tau pedals:
